You are encouraged to work with your fellow students while working on questions from the problem sets. However, the writing of your assignment must be done without any assistance whatsoever.

I, Joseph Siu, affirm that this assignment represents entirely my own efforts. I confirm that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item I have not copied any portion of this work.
  \item I have not allowed someone else in the course to copy this work.
  \item This is the final version of my assignment and not a draft.
  \item I understand the consequences of violating the University's academic integrity policies as outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters.

\section*{EXERCISE 1}
This exercise aims at computing the following indefinite integral

$$
J_{n}=\int \frac{1}{\left(x^{2}+a^{2}\right)^{n}}, n \in \mathbb{N}
$$

\question Compute $J_{1}$.

\question Compute $J_{2}$. (Hint: Consider the substitution $x=\tan t$.)

\question Prove that $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$,

$$
J_{n}=\frac{x}{\left(x^{2}+a^{2}\right)^{n}}+2 n \int \frac{x^{2}}{\left(x^{2}+a^{2}\right)^{n+1}} d x
$$

(Hint: Consider integration by parts.)

\question Based on the previous sub-question, establish the recursive relation:

$$
J_{n+1}=\frac{2 n-1}{2 n} \frac{1}{a^{2}} J_{n}+\frac{1}{2 n a^{2}} \frac{x}{\left(x^{2}+a^{2}\right)^{n}}
$$

From there, conclude that $J_{n}$ is an integral of finite terms (i.e., it is an elementary function) 

\question Compute $J_{3}$.
